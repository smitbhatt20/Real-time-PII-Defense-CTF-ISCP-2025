# Deployment Strategy for Real-time PII Detection & Redaction

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to detect and redact Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in real-time from incoming data streams. The system is designed to prevent sensitive information from leaking while keeping latency low and maintaining accuracy.

## How the Solution Can Be Deployed

### 1. Where the Code Lives
I propose running this PII detector at the **API gateway or middleware layer**. This way, every incoming request or data file is inspected before it reaches the main application. By doing this, we ensure that PII is redacted as early as possible without touching backend systems.

### 2. Containerization
The detector is packaged in a **Docker container**, making it easy to deploy:
- As a **sidecar container** alongside existing services in a Kubernetes environment, OR  
- As a **standalone microservice** behind the API gateway.

### 3. Scalability
The system can scale horizontally:
- Multiple instances can run behind a load balancer to handle high traffic.  
- Kubernetes autoscaling can adjust resources based on demand, ensuring smooth performance even under heavy load.

### 4. Performance and Latency
- The PII detection uses efficient regex-based scanning for structured data.  
- Optional caching for repeated requests reduces processing time further.  
- Redaction happens inline, so the system does not add noticeable delays to the data flow.

### 5. Monitoring & Logging
- Redaction events and system performance are logged to a central logging service (like ELK Stack or Wazuh).  
- This provides audit trails for compliance and helps track potential issues quickly.

### 6. Security
- All redacted data leaves the system already masked, ensuring sensitive information is never exposed.  
- Communication between components uses encrypted channels (TLS/HTTPS).

### 7. Ease of Integration
- The detector can be integrated with existing applications via a simple REST API.  
- Updates to detection rules or regex patterns can be deployed without downtime.

## Benefits
- Real-time protection of PII at the earliest point in the workflow.  
- Scalable and reliable even with large amounts of data.  
- Minimal impact on existing applications.  
- Centralized monitoring for auditing and compliance purposes.
